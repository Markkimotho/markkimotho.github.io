### The Spark
In 2007, a dusty computer in my aunt‚Äôs rural Kenyan home lit a fire in me. I was fascinated by its capabilities and endless possibilities. My first "project"? A meal-planning menu in Microsoft Word to help my mom decide what to cook for the week(Saved her a ton of time and hassle). It was simple, but it was mine‚Äîand it sparked a lifelong love affair with technology.

Around the same time, I met Sam, a new kid on the block who owned an HP computer running Windows Vista. We used to spend countless hours playing video games; building virtual cities in *SimCity* and battling through the pixelated corridors of *Wolfenstein 3D*. These games weren‚Äôt just fun‚Äîthey were my first lessons in systems design. *SimCity* taught me how to work on complex infrastructures, while *Wolfenstein 3D* inspired me to code my own raycasting engine in C. Those early experiences shaped how I see the world: as a series of systems waiting to be understood, optimized, and rebuilt.

### The Journey
Fast forward to today, and I‚Äôm still chasing that same curiosity. I‚Äôve built apps, written about technology, and explored the intersection of code and creativity. My blog, [Mark's Substack](https://ktinega.substack.com), is where I share my thoughts on programming, personal growth, and the future of tech. I‚Äôm also preparing to take the next big step in my journey: graduate studies in computer science, where I hope to dive deeper into artificial intelligence, machine learning, and systems design.

### The Vision
I believe technology is at its best when it solves real problems and improves lives. Whether it‚Äôs building apps, writing code, or exploring new ideas, I‚Äôm driven by the desire to create systems that are elegant, efficient, and impactful. I‚Äôm particularly interested in how Machine Learning and AI can be used to tackle challenges in emerging markets, from healthcare to education to infrastructure.

### Let‚Äôs Connect
I‚Äôm always open to collaborations, conversations, and new ideas. If you‚Äôre working on something exciting or just want to chat about tech, feel free to reach out:
