## Overview

**EduSight Africa** is a production-ready, full-stack machine learning platform that predicts student learning risk across African schools. It serves teachers, parents, and administrators with real-time AI assessments, cultural context detection, and multilingual support across 10 languages and pan-African regions.

The platform uses sophisticated ML models (XGBoost + RandomForest) with 19 engineered features to identify students at risk, providing explainable predictions with per-feature contribution scores so educators understand exactly why a student is flagged.

## AI & Machine Learning

### Multi-Class Risk Prediction Engine

Unlike basic binary classifiers, EduSight Africa uses a **4-level ordinal risk model**:

| Risk Level   | Description                                |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Low**      | Student on track, low intervention need    |
| **Medium**   | Emerging concerns, monitor closely         |
| **High**     | Significant risk, intervention recommended |
| **Critical** | Immediate support required                 |

**Model Details:**

- **Primary Model** - XGBoost (300 estimators, max_depth=6)
- **Baseline Model** - RandomForest (200 estimators, max_depth=12)
- **Calibration** - Platt scaling for reliable probabilities
- **Explainability** - Per-feature contribution scores showing feature importance

### Feature Engineering Pipeline

**19 carefully engineered features** capturing patterns invisible in raw data:

#### Raw Assessment Scores (6)

- Math, Reading, Writing scores
- Behavioral assessment
- Attendance rate

#### Engineered Features (13)

- **score_gap** - Largest spread between subject scores (identifies hidden weaknesses)
- **avg_academic** - Composite academic index across all subjects
- **academic_behavior_mismatch** - Flags good scores with poor behavior (or vice versa)
- **attendance_consistency** - Std deviation of attendance over time (stability signal)
- **home_engagement_score** - Composite from parent observations (homework, reading, sleep)
- **peer_relative_score** - Student performance vs. school/class average
- **school_type** - One-hot encoded (public/private/community)
- **gender** - Demographic feature
- **regional_context** - Pan-African regional weighting
- Plus 4 additional derived features capturing interaction patterns

### Pan-African Synthetic Data Generation

**10,000 realistic student records** generated with country-specific statistical distributions:

- **Regional Coverage** - Kenya, Uganda, Tanzania, Ethiopia, Rwanda, Ghana, Nigeria, Senegal, Morocco, South Africa
- **Score Variance by Country** - Reflects real educational patterns per region
- **Class Imbalance Matching** - Realistic risk distribution
- **Correlated Feature Profiles** - Low attendance + low scores cluster together naturally
- **Grade-Level Appropriate Ranges** - Age and grade-appropriate score distributions
